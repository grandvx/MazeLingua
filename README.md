# MazeLingua : A Systematic Investigation of Gamified Multilingual Proficiency Enhancement via Dynamic Maze Environments

MazeLingua is an educational game built in Unity to facilitate language acquisition through interactive maze navigation. The game offers multiple language options and levels, guiding players through a series of mazes designed to reinforce vocabulary and language comprehension. At the end of each level, players receive feedback on their performance, contributing to an ongoing score dataset that tracks their progress over time.

## Project Overview
MazeLingua leverages gamification in a maze environment to support learning in multiple languages. The game was developed using Unity Hub 3.10.0 with the 3D (Built-In Render Pipeline). The core objective is to immerse players in language challenges as they navigate through different maze levels, reinforcing their vocabulary and language skills interactively.

## Features
- **Multilingual Support**: Choose from a variety of languages to learn and practice.
- **Dynamic Levels**: Progressive maze levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Performance Feedback**: Receive performance-based feedback at the end of each level.
- **Score Tracking**: Scores are recorded in a dataset to track language proficiency and improvement over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and engaging design focusing on language learning.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have **Unity Hub 3.10.0** or later installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/grandvx/MazeLingua.git
2. Open Unity Hub and click Add, then select the cloned project folder.
3. Open the project in Unity and ensure that the 3D (Built-In Render Pipeline) is set.

## Getting Started
1. Select a Language: Choose a language from the list of available options.
2. Start Playing: Begin navigating through the maze, encountering language tasks and challenges.
3. Receive Feedback: After completing each level, review your score and feedback to see your progress.
4. Track Improvement: Use the dataset feature to track scores over time and monitor proficiency

## Gameplay
MazeLingua requires players to navigate through a maze while encountering language-based tasks or questions. Correct answers enable players to proceed, while incorrect answers may result in additional challenges or score deductions.

## Languages and Levels
* **Languagues**: Multiple languages are available for selection at the start of the game. As of right now the options are: Greek, English, French and Spanish. More to come!
* **Levels**: Each language has multiple levels that increase in difficulty, offering both vocabulary and comprehension tasks.

## Data Tracking and Scoring
The game tracks players' scores across each level, storing data in a dataset for analysis and progress monitoring. Players can view their proficiency levels in real-time and understand areas for improvement based on their scores.
